# MAESH_InteractiveMateriality
Source codes from course project "MÃ†SH", Interactive Materiality Q1 24/25 TU/e.
All sketches are named A/P# with respect to software and time of progression in process.
As such each sketch as a rule of thumb builds on the previous sketch.

Relies on the Kinect Blob Tracking library by Halfdan Hauch:
